# Product Context

This project exists to streamline solving and documenting computer science problems by harnessing the power of large language models. It addresses common pain points:

1. Manual effort in writing algorithm explanations and pseudocode  
2. Repetitive boilerplate when implementing well-known algorithms in code  
3. Lack of quick visual diagrams to illustrate solution steps  

Key user experience goals:
- One-command initiation for generating explanations, diagrams, and code  
- Clear, structured output in language-agnostic formats (Markdown, Mermaid, code files)  
- Configurable behavior via a simple JSON schema or command-line flags  
- Minimal setup: installs via PyPI or source script, auto-generates API-key template
