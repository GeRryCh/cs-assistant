# Progress

## What Works
- CLI commands `create-config` and `solve` operate correctly.
- Configuration can be provided via JSON file or command-line arguments.
- LLM API integrations (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) return structured JSON.
- Output directory structure and file-writing for solutions functions as expected.
- Memory Bank files for project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context, and active context have been initialized.

## What's Left to Build
- Write unit tests for `IssueSolver.solve` and field-processing methods.
- Enhance error handling and user feedback for API failures.
- Add logging support for debugging and audit trails.
- Document contribution guidelines and coding standards.
- Expand Memory Bank entries when introducing new modules or commands.

## Current Status
Memory Bank initialization complete; core CLI and solve functionality stable. Test coverage and docs expansion are next priorities.

## Known Issues
- Limited test coverage for solution processing.
- Edge cases in filename sanitization may require tuning.
- No end-to-end integration tests for LLM responses.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Switched from a generic `.env` file to a dedicated `.csarc` template for API keys.
- Adopted dataclasses and JSON Schema for strong-typed configuration.
- Introduced Memory Bank for self-documentation and on-boarding.
