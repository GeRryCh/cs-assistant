# Progress

## What Works
- CLI commands `create-config` and `solve` operate correctly.
- Configuration can be provided via JSON file or command-line arguments.
- LLM API integrations (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) return structured JSON.
- Output directory structure and file-writing for solutions functions as expected.
- Memory Bank files for project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context, and active context have been initialized.
- Configuration schema for `code_implementations` has been flattened, and related Python files (`src/config.py`, `src/solve.py`) updated accordingly.
- The string formatting placeholder for code languages in `src/solve.py`'s user prompt construction has been renamed from `{languages}` to `{code_languages}` for improved clarity.

## What's Left to Build
- Write unit tests for `IssueSolver.solve` and field-processing methods.
- Enhance error handling and user feedback for API failures.
- Add logging support for debugging and audit trails.
- Document contribution guidelines and coding standards.
- Expand Memory Bank entries when introducing new modules or commands.

## Current Status
Core CLI and solve functionality stable. Configuration refactoring for `code_implementations` is complete. Test coverage and docs expansion are next priorities.

## Known Issues
- Limited test coverage for solution processing.
- Edge cases in filename sanitization may require tuning.
- No end-to-end integration tests for LLM responses.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Switched from a generic `.env` file to a dedicated `.csarc` template for API keys.
- Adopted dataclasses and JSON Schema for strong-typed configuration.
- Introduced Memory Bank for self-documentation and on-boarding.
- Refactored `code_implementations` in `config.schema.json` to be a direct list of strings, simplifying the structure.
- Renamed placeholder in `src/solve.py` from `{languages}` to `{code_languages}`.
