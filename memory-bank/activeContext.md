# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initializing the Memory Bank for CS Assistant.
- Capturing project overview, product goals, architecture patterns, and technology context.

## Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` with core objectives and scope.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md` outlining user problems and UX goals.
- Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` documenting architecture layers and design patterns.
- Created `memory-bank/techContext.md` describing technologies, dependencies, and setup instructions.

## Next Steps
- Maintain and update Memory Bank files as new features are developed.
- Draft `activeContext.md` (this file) and `progress.md` to track ongoing status.
- Integrate new commands or modules into the Memory Bank when architecture evolves.
- Review and refine existing Memory Bank content after major refactors or releases.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Memory Bank directory structure under `memory-bank/`.
- Use Markdown for all context files.
- Follow Clineâ€™s strict write/read rules for consistency.
- Immutable dataclass-based configuration guides implementation.

## Learnings & Insights
- Modular layering simplifies CLI extension.
- JSON Schema plus dataclasses ensures robust configuration validation.
- Field-by-field prompt builders enable dynamic LLM integrations.
