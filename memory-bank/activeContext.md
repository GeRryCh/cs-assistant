# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Refactoring configuration schema and related Python files.

## Recent Changes
- Flattened the `code_implementations` structure in `config.schema.json`.
- Updated `src/config.py` to reflect the new schema for `code_implementations` (changed from a nested object to a direct list of strings).
- Modified `src/solve.py` to correctly access the `code_implementations` list from the updated `SolveConfig`.
- Renamed the string formatting placeholder for code languages from `{languages}` to `{code_languages}` in `src/solve.py` (within `USER_PROMPT_FIELDS` and its usage in `_build_user_prompt`) for clarity.
- Updated Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) to reflect these changes.

## Next Steps
- Write unit tests for `IssueSolver.solve` and field-processing methods in `src/solve.py`.
- Continue with other development tasks or refactoring as needed.
- Ensure all Memory Bank files are kept up-to-date with any further changes.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Memory Bank directory structure under `memory-bank/`.
- Use Markdown for all context files.
- Follow Clineâ€™s strict write/read rules for consistency.
- Immutable dataclass-based configuration guides implementation.
- Flattening configuration structures can improve clarity and ease of use.

## Learnings & Insights
- Modular layering simplifies CLI extension.
- JSON Schema plus dataclasses ensures robust configuration validation.
- Field-by-field prompt builders enable dynamic LLM integrations.
- Keeping configuration parsing logic (`src/config.py`) and its usage (`src/solve.py`) in sync with the schema (`config.schema.json`) is crucial.
