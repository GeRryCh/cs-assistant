# Project Brief

CS Assistant is a command-line interface tool designed to help users solve computer science problems by leveraging large language models (LLMs). The core objectives are:

1. Automate algorithmic reasoning  
   - Generate clear verbal explanations of algorithms  
   - Produce pseudocode and visual diagrams (Mermaid)  

2. Provide multi-language code implementations  
   - Support Python, JavaScript, and other languages  
   - Allow configurable output directories and formats  

3. Seamless user experience  
   - Simple CLI interface with common commands (`create-config`, `solve`)  
   - Flexible configuration via JSON or CLI arguments  
   - Automatic environment setup for API keys  

4. Robust architecture and maintainability  
   - Modular design for LLM clients, configuration, and solvers  
   - Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality  
   - Easily extensible to new models, languages, or output formats  

This project delivers a reliable, easy-to-use assistant for educators, students, and developers to quickly prototype and document solutions to CS challenges.
